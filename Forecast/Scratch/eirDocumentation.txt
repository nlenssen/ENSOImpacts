My EIR work is currently fragmented. The first full attempt of paper figures can be found in `igPlots.R`. The functions used in this file are found in `igFunctions.R` and were developed in the poorly documented `igWork.R`. This makes the ignorance analogue of the following paper figures which can be found in ~/Desktop/scratchPlots/igTest. They all agree with what I expected and appear to be self consistent. In other words, "THEY LOOK SO GOOD WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY WRONG IT IS SO EASY IF THEY ARE JUST THESE"

However, the EIR calculation is likely suspect. The culprit is the difference between the EIR and the "average EIR". Since EIR assumes compounding gains in time, the effective interest rate of a series (at a single location) allows the carrying of success/failure from one time point to the next. The main clue for this is that it is exponentiated.

I have attempted to fix the EIR calculation in the file `eirWork.R` where I attempt to implement the EIR as decribed in Simon's guidance. I wrote the function `eirCalcFull()` to calculate the field, series, and total EIR for a forecast all at once. In doing so I have a few different issues

- Field EIR is not equal to field REIR
	This is fine, it would be stranger if it was somehow

- Series EIR results nonsense?
	This is much less fine, the deterministic forecast has by far the highest EIR in the series. I could throw that out as  I need to make sure this isn't a bug. Do not know how to interpret 

- Total EIR does not reflect mean series EIR



Thoughts:
- The EIR could be having issues as I am issuing 0 probabilities in some categories in my ENSO forecast. In addition, I am throwing out the Inf ignorance when they occur. Thus, I am skewing my results! I should instead switch my ENSO forecasts to issue 1 percent outcome (or something small that I can change) for 0 count categories to get proper IGN/EIR without my present incorrect way of handling infinity! This is the first priority

	- This can't be the issue for the IRI or ENSO-prob forecasts as there are no 0 or 1 probability forecasts issued (simon anticipated this one early!). The infinity I was remembering were in the RIGN decomposition when bins had strange low-sample size issued. There should be no instances of Inf ignorance forecasts in the non-det forecasts...

	- I'm officially out of ideas...
